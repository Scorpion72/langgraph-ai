Host Agent - MCP A2A Agentic RAG System

The Host Agent serves as the primary coordinator and entry point for the MCP A2A (Model Context Protocol Agent-to-Agent) Agentic RAG system. It acts as an intelligent router and orchestrator that analyzes user queries and determines the optimal processing strategy.

Key Functions:
- Query analysis and intent recognition
- Agent coordination and delegation
- Conversation management and context preservation
- Direct response generation for appropriate queries
- MCP tool integration and management

The Host Agent ensures efficient query processing by intelligently routing requests to specialized agents (like the Agentic RAG Agent) when complex knowledge retrieval is needed, while handling straightforward queries directly to minimize response time and system overhead.
